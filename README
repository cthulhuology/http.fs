http.fs - A simple sample webserver for gforth
----------------------------------------------

This is a simple webserver for gforth.  It requires the unix/socket.fs code to
work.  Currently the server is extended by defining additional routes to handle
various paths.  It also uses parsing words to evaluate the HTTP headers, and
will gladly die if it encounters anything unexpected.

The home page is served via:

: /. ( -- s-addr u ) ... ;

Which returns the body of the home page.  There is also a sample of returning json in /foo.

Obviously this is a work in progress, but is inteded to eventually work in a non-gforth
based embedded system.  

To run:

	gforth http.fs

Currently it is configured to listen on 8080. YMMV.
